        <p><strong>Tara McKnight's Project</strong></p>
        <p>The game I created for this project is a game I refer to as <strong>Savant</strong> which is a text based adventure game involving a weak gangly knight who has been tricked into saving the Princess Amber who has been abducted by a dragon named Emrys. This knight has been tricked into saving the princess alone and in the game there are four rooms including the start room. Generally this game involves a few puzzles and is set up in a specific way so that to succeed in one room you must have visited another room prior. However, other puzzles simply involving some abstract thinking.</p>

        <p>This is one of the mulitple endings in which the playable character dies. However, this particular ending also happens to be the final room of the game. </p>

        <p><strong>REFLECTION</strong></p>
        <p>The game is undoubtedly short, shorter than I would have liked, but due to the time restriction I had to cut a lot of things out of the game that I had initially planned to include. Albeit there were quite a few things I didn't like about the game, I did like how I was able to include some sarcasm at certain points, which allowed me to actually make the game mine by including some of my painfully lame humor. </p>

        <p><strong>THE STRUGGLE IS REAL</strong></p>
        <p>Something I definitely struggled with whilst working on this project was the nesting of multiple if statements, which is basically the majority of any text based game. So coding the multiple routes and endings was difficult for me, mainly due to the arrangement and placement of the code which I had to change multiple times in order for the program to run properly. I also struggled with time limit as I stated previously, as there were many moments in which I had planned to include something only to realize I didn't have enough time to do it and then have to change the structure and the story of the entire game to fit the time constraint, and then meet all the requirements with what I could actually finish in the time given.</p>
