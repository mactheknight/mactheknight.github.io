        <p>This is my website, woop woop.</p>
        <p>The game I created for this project is a game I refer to as <strong>Savant</strong> which is a text based adventure game involving a weak gangly knight who has been tricked into saving the Princess Amber who has been abducted by a dragon named Emrys. This knight has been tricked into saving the princess alone and in the game there are four rooms including the start room.</p> 
        <p>Generally this game involves a few puzzles and is set up in a specific way so that to succeed in one room you must have visited another room prior. However, other puzzles simply involving some abstract thinking.</p>

        <p>The game is undoubtedly short, shorter than I would have liked, but due to the time restriction I had to cut a lot of things out of the game that I had initially planned to include. </p>
